GMapRotate
===

This is a little map rotation addon I made for servers.
This addon is still in development, and may have some issues. Please report them in the issues tab.

Download
===

[Here is the latest release of the addon](https://github.com/ajgeiss0702/GMapRotate/releases/latest)


Installation
===

1. Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/ajgeiss0702/GMapRotate/releases/latest).
2. Unzip the archive
3. Drag unzipped folder to your garrysmod/addons folder of your server
4. List your maps in lua/nextmap/sv_gmr_config.lua
5. Restart the server or change the map
6. Check that it worked by typing `!nextmap` in chat (should say what the next map will be) or `gmr_version` in console (should say the version)
7. Enjoy!



Configuration
===

The configuration is pretty simple. just go to lua/autorun/sv_config.lua, and everything should be explained in there.
