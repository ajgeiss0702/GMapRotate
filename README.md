# GMapRotate

This is a little map rotation addon I made for servers.
This addon is still in development, and may have some issues. Please report them in the issues tab.


# Installation

To install this addon, just put the folder into the addons folder.
NOTE: This addon only works with a gamemode that reloads the map every couple of rounds. This will do nothing in a sandbox server
Sometime I will add a feature for it to work in sandbox (or other gamemodes) but thats not for a little while


# Configuration

The configuration is in the first couple of lines in nextmap.lua
There are instructions in there on how to use it.
