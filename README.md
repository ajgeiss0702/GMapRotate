# GMapRotate

This is a little map rotation addon I made for servers.
This addon is still in development, and may have some issues. Please report them in the issues tab.

# Download

[Here is the latest release of the addon](https://github.com/ajgeiss0702/GMapRotate/releases/latest)


# Installation

Instalation instructions: 
1. Download latest release (or the code directly)
2. Unzip the archive
3. Put the unzipped archive into your garrysmod/addons folder
4. Configure
NOTE: This addon only works with a gamemode that reloads the map every couple of rounds. This will do nothing in a sandbox server
Sometime I will add a feature for it to work in sandbox (or other gamemodes) but thats not for a little while


# Configuration

The configuration is pretty simple. just go to lua/autorun/sv_config.lua, and everything should be explained in there.
